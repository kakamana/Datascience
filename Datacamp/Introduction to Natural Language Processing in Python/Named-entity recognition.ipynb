    "\n",
    "Throughout this chapter, you will learn how to use pre-trained models on English and non-English texts to identify who, what, and where in your texts. This course introduces a slightly more advanced topic: named entity recognition. You will also learn how to use two new libraries to enhance your Natural Language Processing toolkit, polyglot and spaCy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This **Named-entity recognition** is part of [Datacamp course: Introduction to Natural Language Processing in Python] You will learn the basics of natural language processing (NLP), such as how to identify and separate words, how to extract topics from a text, and how to construct your own fake news classifier. As part of this course, you will also learn how to use basic libraries such as NLTK as well as libraries that utilize deep learning to solve common NLP problems. The purpose of this course is to provide you with the foundation for processing and parsing text as you progress through your Python learning journey.\n",
