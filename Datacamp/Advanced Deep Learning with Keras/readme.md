# Advanced Deep Learning with Keras

Course by [DataCamp](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/advanced-deep-learning-with-keras)  
Part of [Machine Learning Scientist with Python](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/machine-learning-scientist-with-python)  
  
Introduction  

With the Keras functional API, you will learn how to use a variety of algorithms, starting with simple, multi-layer dense networks (also known as multi-layer perceptrons). We will cover advanced topics, such as category embeddings and multiple-output networks, and how to share weights between layers in a model. The course will also cover how to build models with multiple inputs and a single output. You can train a network that does both classification and regression with this course!

Course Takeaways:

* The Keras Functional API 
* Two Input Networks Using Categorical Embeddings, Shared Layers, and Merge Layers 
* Multiple Inputs: 3 Inputs (and Beyond!)
* Multiple Outputs
