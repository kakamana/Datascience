    "# The Keras Functional API\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter introduces you to the basics of Keras' functional API. By using functional building blocks, you will construct a simple functional network, fit it to data, and make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This **The Keras Functional API** is part of [Datacamp course: Advanced Deep Learning with Keras] You will learn how to use the versatile Keras functional API to solve a variety of problems. The course will begin with simple, multi-layer dense networks (also known as multi-layer perceptrons) and progress to more sophisticated architectures. This course will cover how to construct models with multiple inputs and a single output, as well as how to share weights between layers in a model. Additionally, we will discuss advanced topics such as category embeddings and multiple output networks. This course will teach you how to train a network that performs both classification and regression.\n",
