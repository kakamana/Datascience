# Case Study: School Budgeting with Machine Learning in Python

Course by [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/case-study-school-budgeting-with-machine-learning-in-python)  
Part of [Data Scientist with Python Track](https://learn.datacamp.com/career-tracks/data-scientist-with-python?version=4)  
  
Introduction  

There's more to data science than predicting ad clicks! This is a case study from DrivenData's machine learning competition. 
A school district budgeting problem will be explored. Automatically classifying items in a school's budget makes it easier for schools to compare their spending 
with other schools. This course starts by building a simple, first-pass baseline model. To prepare budgets for modeling, you'll do some natural language processing. 
The next step is to try your own techniques and see how they compare to others'. To build the most accurate model, the winner combined a number of expert techniques.
  
Course Takeaways:  

- We will explore raw data related to school budgeting case study. 

- Then we will build first very simple model with introudction to natural language processing (NLP). 

- Then we will see how to improve & fine tune our model.

- For all above we will be using scikit-learn libraries.
