Introduction  

In order to build powerful machine learning models, you need to use a variety of hyperparameters. But with increasingly complex models with a lot of options, how can you efficiently select the right ones? You will learn some common methods for tuning hyperparameters using Scikit Learn in Python. Grid Search, Random Search, Bayesian, & Genetic algorithms are among the advanced optimization methodologies. As you build skills, you will use a dataset predicting credit card defaults to dramatically improve your machine learning performance.

Course Takeaways:

* Hyperparameters and Parameters 
* Grid search 
* Random Search
* Informed Search
