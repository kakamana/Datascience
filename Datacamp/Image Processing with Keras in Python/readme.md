Introduction  

A deep learning method for image processing uses data to train neural network algorithms. Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), you can classify images using different types of objects. You will learn how to construct, train, and evaluate CNNs with Keras in this four-hour course. 

Deep learning involves transforming images into data and teaching neural networks to classify them. It has a wide range of applications, from helping eCommerce sites manage inventory easily to helping cancer researchers detect dangerous melanomas quickly. This course shows you how to view images as data and train a neural network to classify objects in images using Keras. 

A fundamental part of CNNs, convolutions, will be covered in the second chapter. You'll learn how they operate on image data and how to train and tweak your Keras CNN with test data. The course goes into more detail and teaches you how to make deep learning networks. You'll finish by learning how to track CNN performance and how to improve it. Once you've built Keras neural networks and optimized them, you can visualize the responses across a range of scenarios.
