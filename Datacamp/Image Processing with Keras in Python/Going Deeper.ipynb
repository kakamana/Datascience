    "# Going Deeper\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional neural networks gain a great deal of power when they are constructed with multiple layers (deep networks). You will learn how to stack multiple convolutional layers into a deep network in this chapter. As the network grows, you will also learn how to keep track of the number of parameters and how to control it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This **Going Deeper** is part of [Datacamp course: Image Processing with Keras in Python] Deep learning methods are used in image processing to train neural network algorithms to perform various machine learning tasks. Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), you will be able to classify different types of objects for the analysis of images. In this four-hour course, you will be taught how to construct, train, and evaluate CNNs using Keras.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a challenging task to turn images into data and train neural networks to classify them using deep learning. It has extensive applications in business and research ranging from helping eCommerce sites manage inventory more efficiently to assisting cancer researchers to identify dangerous melanoma quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first chapter of this course, you will learn how images can be viewed as data and how you can use Keras to train a neural network to classify objects within an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "A fundamental component of CNNs is convolutions, which will be discussed in the second chapter. Through the use of test data, you will learn how Keras CNNs operate on image data and how to train and tweak your Keras CNN. In later chapters, you will learn how to create a deep learning network in greater detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, you will learn how to track the performance of a CNN and how to improve it. By this point, you will be able to create Keras neural networks, optimize them, and visualize their responses across a variety of applications.\n",
