Course by [DataCamp](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/feature-engineering-for-nlp-in-python)  
Part of [Machine Learning Scientist with Python](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/machine-learning-scientist-with-python)  
  
Introduction  

As part of this course, you will learn how to extract valuable information from text and convert it into ML models suitable for machine learning. You will learn how to use scikit-learn and spaCy to implement POS tagging, named entity recognition, readability scores, and the n-gram and tf-idf models. You will also learn how similar two documents are. After the course, you will be able to engineer critical features out of any text and solve some of the most challenging data science problems!

Course Takeaways:

* Basic features and readability scores  
* Text preprocessing, POS tagging and NER 
* N-Gram models
* TF-IDF and similarity scores
