    "# Basic features and readability scores\n",
    "\n",
    "You will learn how to calculate basic features such as word count, character count, average word length, and special characters (such as Twitter hashtags and mentions). In addition, you will be taught how to compute readability scores and how much education is required to comprehend text.\n",
    "\n",
    "This **Basic features and readability scores\" classifier** is part of [Datacamp course: Introduction to Natural Language Processing in Python] This course teaches techniques for extracting useful information from text and converting it into a format suitable for ML models. You will learn about POS tagging, named entity recognition, readability scores, n-gram and tf-idf models, and how to implement them using scikit-learn and spaCy. Additionally, you will learn how to calculate the similarity between two documents. During this process, you will be able to predict the sentiment of movie reviews and build recommenders for movies and Ted Talks. In the course of this course, you will learn how to engineer critical features from any text and solve some of the most challenging problems in data science.\n",
