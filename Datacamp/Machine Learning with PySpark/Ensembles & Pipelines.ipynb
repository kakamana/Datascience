    "Finally, you will learn how to improve the efficiency of your models. By using pipelines, you will be able to make your code more clear and easier to maintain. To test your models more effectively and select good model parameters, you will use cross-validation. Last but not least, you will experiment with two types of ensemble models.\n",

    "This **Ensembles & Pipelines** is part of [Datacamp course: Machine Learning with PySpark] Spark is a powerful, general-purpose tool for working with large data sets. Spark transparently distributes compute tasks across a cluster. By doing this, operations are fast, but you can also focus on the analysis rather than worry about technical details. This course will teach you how to get data into Spark, and then dive into three fundamental Spark Machine Learning algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression/Classifiers, and creating pipelines. You will analyze a large dataset of flight delays and spam text messages along the way. With this background, you will be able to harness the power of Spark and apply it to your own Machine Learning projects.\n",
