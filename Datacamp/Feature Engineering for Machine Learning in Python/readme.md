Introduction  

Machine learning is changing the world every day with amazing breakthroughs. There is often a tendency to gloss over the fact that a lot of data munching and feature engineering has to be performed before any fancy models can be used. In this course, you will learn exactly how to do that. We will use Stack Overflow Developers survey and historic US presidential inauguration addresses to learn how to preprocess, engineer, and analyze categorical, continuous, and unstructured data. In this course, you will learn how to prepare any data for machine learning.
Course Takeaways:

* Creating Features  
* Dealing with Messy Data
* Conforming to Statistical Assumptions
* Dealing with Text Data
