**Learn how to train models using labeled data using scikit-learn, a popular Python library for machine learning. This course will teach you how to predict things like whether a customer will churn from your business, whether an individual has diabetes, or even if a song is in a particular genre. Through the use of real-world datasets, you will learn how to build predictive models, tune their parameters, and evaluate their performance.**
