    "With the help of a dataset on advertising expenditures, you will learn about regression and develop models to predict sales values. In addition to learning linear regression mechanics, you will be introduced to common performance metrics like R-squared and root mean squared error. In order to reduce the risk of overfitting, you will perform cross-validation k-fold and apply regularization to regression models.\n",

Based on features such as a country's GDP, fertility rate, and population, you will use this data to predict life expectancy in that country. The dataset has been preprocessed as in Chapter 1.\n",

    "The target variable here is quantitative, so this is a regression problem. First, you will fit a linear regression with one feature: 'fertility', which is the average number of children a woman gives birth to in a given country. Regression models will be built using all the features in later exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you must import the data and prepare it for scikit-learn. Feature and target variable arrays must be created. Additionally, since you will only use one feature to begin with, you'll need to reshape it using NumPy's .reshape() method."

    "Now, you will fit a linear regression and predict life expectancy using just one feature. You saw Andy do this earlier using the 'RM' feature of the Boston housing dataset. In this exercise, you will use the 'fertility' feature of the Gapminder dataset. Since the goal is to predict life expectancy, the target variable here is 'life'. The array for the target variable has been pre-loaded as y and the array for 'fertility' has been pre-loaded as X_fertility.\n",
    "\n",
    "A scatter plot with 'fertility' on the x-axis and 'life' on the y-axis has been generated. As you can see, there is a strongly negative correlation, so a linear regression should be able to capture this trend.
