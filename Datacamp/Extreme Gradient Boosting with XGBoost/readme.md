Introduction  

If you are familiar with supervised learning and wish to apply state-of-the-art methods to real-world datasets, gradient boosting is one of the most popular techniques. Gradient boosting models using XGBoost regularly win online data science competitions and are used at scale across many industries, using XGBoost. With this course, we will build and tune supervised learning models using pandas and scikit-learn. We will assess data using real-world datasets.

Course Takeaways:

* Classification with XGBoost  
* Regression with XGBoost
* Fine-tuning your XGBoost model 
* Using XGBoost in pipelines
