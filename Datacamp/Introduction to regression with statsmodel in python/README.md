Part of [Data Scientist with Python Track](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/data-scientist-with-python)  
  
Introduction  

There are two types of statistical models that are widely used: linear regression and logistic regression. Their role is to unlock the secrets hidden within your data, like a master key. Through these exercises and content, we will learn how to fit simple linear and logistic regressions. We will explore real-world datasets, including motor insurance claims, Taiwan house prices, fish sizes, and more, through hands-on exercises. We will discuss how to make predictions from provided data, quantify model performance, and diagnose problems related to the fit of models.

Course Takeaways:

* Simple Linear Regression Modeling 
* Predictions and model objects
* Assessing model fit
* Simple Logistic Regression Modeling
