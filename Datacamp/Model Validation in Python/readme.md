Introduction  

Model validation allows analysts to confidently answer the question, how good is your model, even when it's easier to implement than ever before. Without it, the results of running new data through a model won't be as accurate. This question will be answered for classification models using tic-tac-toe endgame scenarios and for regression models using fivethirtyeight's Halloween candy power ranking dataset. A basic understanding of model validation will be taught, as will various validation techniques and tools for creating high-performing models.

Course Takeaways:

* Basic Modeling in scikit-learn  
* Validation Basics
* Cross Validation
* Selecting the best model with Hyperparameter tuning.
