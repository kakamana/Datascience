    "# Cross Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Holdout sets are an excellent starting point for model validation. It is important to note, however, that using one train and one test set is often not sufficient. When tuning model hyperparameters, cross-validation is considered the gold standard for validating model performance. The purpose of this chapter is to demonstrate how to perform cross-validation in order to validate the performance of a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This **Cross Validation** is part of [Datacamp course: Model Validation in Python] which describe about model validation as t has never been easier to implement machine learning models than it is today. The results of running new data through a model may not be as accurate as expected without proper validation. Validation of models allows analysts to answer confidently the question, \"How good is your model?\". This question will be addressed for classification models using the complete set of tic-tac-toe endgame scenarios, and for regression models using fivethirtyeight's ultimate Halloween candy power ranking dataset. The purpose of this course is to introduce the basics of model validation, to discuss various validation techniques, and to begin to develop tools for creating high-performance and validated models.\n",
