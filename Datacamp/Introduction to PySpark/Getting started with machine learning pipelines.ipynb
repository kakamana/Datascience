    "\n",
    "As part of PySpark, cutting-edge machine learning routines are included, as well as utilities that can be used to create full machine learning pipelines. In this chapter, you will learn more about them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This **Getting started with machine learning pipelines** is part of [Datacamp course: Introduction to PySpark] This course will teach you how to use Spark from Python. As a tool for performing parallel computations on large datasets, Spark integrates well with Python. The Python package PySpark is responsible for making the magic happen. You will use this package to work with flight data from Portland and Seattle. Using this data, you will build a machine learning pipeline to predict whether or not flights will be delayed. Get ready to dive into the world of high-performance machine learning with some Spark in your Python code!\n",
