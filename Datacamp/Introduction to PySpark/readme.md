Course by [DataCamp](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-pyspark)  
Part of [Machine Learning Scientist with Python](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/machine-learning-scientist-with-python)  
  
Introduction  

We will learn how to use Spark with Python in this course! Spark is a tool for parallel computing large datasets, and PySpark is the Python package that makes it all happen. As part of this course, you'll work with data about flights from Portland and Seattle. You'll learn how to use this data and build a machine learning pipeline to predict flight delays. Put a little Spark into your Python code to go deep into the world of machine learning!

Course Takeaways:

* Getting to know PySpark 
* Manipulating data 
* Getting started with machine learning pipelines
* Model tuning and selection
