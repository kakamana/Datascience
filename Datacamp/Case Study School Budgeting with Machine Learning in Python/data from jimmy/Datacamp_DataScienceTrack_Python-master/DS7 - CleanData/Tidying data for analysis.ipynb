    "### Reshaping your data using melt\n",
    "Melting data is the process of turning columns of your data into rows of data. Consider the DataFrames from the previous exercise. In the tidy DataFrame, the variables Ozone, Solar.R, Wind, and Temp each had their own column. If, however, you wanted these variables to be in rows instead, you could melt the DataFrame. In doing so, however, you would make the data untidy! This is important to keep in mind: Depending on how your data is represented, you will have to reshape it differently (e.g., this could make it easier to plot values).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will practice melting a DataFrame using pd.melt(). There are two parameters you should be aware of: id_vars and value_vars. The id_vars represent the columns of the data you do not want to melt (i.e., keep it in its current shape), while the value_vars represent the columns you do wish to melt into rows. By default, if no value_vars are provided, all columns not set in the id_vars will be melted. This could save a bit of typing, depending on the number of columns that need to be melted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The (tidy) DataFrame airquality has been pre-loaded. Your job is to melt its Ozone, Solar.R, Wind, and Temp columns into rows. Later in this chapter, you'll learn how to bring this melted DataFrame back into a tidy form."

    "Another common way multiple variables are stored in columns is with a delimiter. You'll learn how to deal with such cases in this exercise, using a dataset consisting of Ebola cases and death counts by state and country. It has been pre-loaded into a DataFrame as ebola.\n",

    "Print the columns of ebola in the IPython Shell using ebola.columns. Notice that the data has column names such as Cases_Guinea and Deaths_Guinea. Here, the underscore _ serves as a delimiter between the first part (cases or deaths), and the second part (country).\n",
    "\n",
    "This time, you cannot directly slice the variable by position as in the previous exercise. You now need to use Python's built-in string method called .split(). By default, this method will split a string into parts separated by a space. However, in this case you want it to split by an underscore. You can do this on 'Cases_Guinea', for example, using 'Cases_Guinea'.split('_'), which returns the list ['Cases', 'Guinea'].\n",
    "\n",
    "The next challenge is to extract the first element of this list and assign it to a type variable, and the second element of the list to a country variable. You can accomplish this by accessing the str attribute of the column and using the .get() method to retrieve the 0 or 1 index, depending on the part you want."
