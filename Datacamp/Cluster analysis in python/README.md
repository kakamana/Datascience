# Case Study: School Budgeting with Machine Learning in Python

Course by [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/cluster-analysis-in-python)  
Part of [Data Scientist with Python Track](https://learn.datacamp.com/career-tracks/data-scientist-with-python?version=4)  
  
Introduction  

Perhaps you've come across Google News, which groups similar news articles into topics. Have you ever wondered what process is involved in arriving at these groups
in the background? Through the use of the SciPy library in Python, you will be introduced to unsupervised learning through clustering. The course covers the 
pre-processing of data and the application of hierarchical and k-means clustering. As part of this course, you will explore player statistics from a popular football
video game, FIFA 18. After completing the course, you will be able to quickly apply various clustering algorithms on data, visualize the clusters formed and analyze 
results.
  
Course Takeaways:  

- Introduction to clustering to familiarize with unsuprvised learning using machine learning algorriths like hierarchical & k-means clustering. 

- Hierarchical clustering using SciPy & its implementation introduction. 

- k-means clustering using SciPy & its implemenation.

- Basic implemnation for dominant color in an image & clustering / grouping of news articles.
