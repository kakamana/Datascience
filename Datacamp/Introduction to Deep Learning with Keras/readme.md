Introduction  

With unstructured data, deep learning is the go-to technique to solve complex problems, as well as an incredible innovation tool. A framework like Keras makes developing deep learning models easier, and it is versatile enough to build models that are industry-ready in no time at all. The purpose of this course is to teach regression and save the planet by predicting asteroid trajectories, apply binary classification to distinguish between real and fake bills, determine who threw which dart at a dart board with multiclass classification, and reconstruct noisy images using neural networks. Also, you will learn to optimize your models during training.

Course Takeaways:

* Introducing Keras  
* Going Deeper
* Improving Your Model Performance
* Advanced Model Architectures
