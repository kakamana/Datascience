Introduction  

Inference statistics and hypothesis testing rely heavily on sampling in Python. This skill is used in survey analysis and experimental design in order to draw conclusions without having to survey the entire population. In this Sampling in Python course, you will learn how to conduct common types of sampling, such as random sampling, stratified sampling, and cluster sampling. By generating sampling distributions and bootstrap distributions from real-world datasets, such as coffee ratings, Spotify songs, and employee attrition, you will learn to estimate population statistics and quantify uncertainty in your estimates.

Course Takeaways:

* Introduction to Sampling  
* Sampling Methods 
* Sampling Distributions
* Bootstrap Distributions
