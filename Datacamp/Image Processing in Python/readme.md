Introduction  

We live in a world where images contain a lot of information, which can be difficult to obtain. This is why image processing has become an extremely valuable skill, applicable to many scenarios. You'll be able to process, transform, and manipulate images at your leisure in this course. Additionally, scikit-image will allow you to repair damaged images, reduce noise, smart-resize images, count dice dots, detect faces, and much more. With the knowledge you gain from this course, you will be able to apply your skills to a variety of fields, including machine learning, artificial intelligence, robotics, space and medical image analysis, retailing, and much more. Discover computer vision for yourself!

Course Takeaways:

* Introducing Image Processing and scikit-image 
* Filters, Contrast, Transformation and Morphology 
* Image restoration, Noise, Segmentation and Contours
* Advanced Operations, Detecting Faces and Features
