    "As a result of completing this chapter, you will have a deeper understanding of image processing since you will be able to detect edges, corners, and even faces! Not only will you learn how to detect front faces, but also profile faces, cats, and dogs as well. Your skills will be applied to more complex real-world applications. With only a few lines of code, you will be able to master several widely used image processing techniques!\n",

    "This **Advanced Operations, Detecting Faces and Features** is part of [Datacamp course: Image Processing in Python] There are images everywhere! Today, images contain a great deal of information that is sometimes difficult to access. Thus, image pre-processing has become a highly valuable skill, applicable to a wide range of applications. As a result of taking this course, you will be able to process, transform, and manipulate images at your discretion, no matter how many there are. Additionally, you will learn how to use scikit-image to restore damaged images, perform noise reduction, smart-resize images, count the number of dots on a dice, apply facial detection, and much more. You will be able to apply your knowledge of machine learning and artificial intelligence, machine and robotic vision, space and medical image analysis, retailing, and many other fields after completing this course. Take the step and dive into the wonderful world of computer vision!\n",
