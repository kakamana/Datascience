Introduction  

We will cover how and when to perform data preprocessing. Preprocessing is a crucial part of any machine learning project. It occurs between importing your data, cleaning it, and fitting your machine learning model. It will show you how to standardize your data, create new features to better utilize your dataset, and select the features that will enhance your model. Finally, you'll get some practice preprocessing by getting a dataset on UFO sightings ready for modeling.

Course Takeaways:

* Introduction to Data Preprocessing   
* Standardizing Data
* Feature Engineering 
* Selecting Features for Modeling 
* Putting It All Together
