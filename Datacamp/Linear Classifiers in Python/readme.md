Part of [Machine Learning Scientist with Python](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/machine-learning-scientist-with-python)  
  
Introduction  

With scikit-learn, you'll learn how to use linear classifiers, particularly logistic regression and support vector machines. As we explore how to apply these methods, we'll explore the concepts behind them. We will learn how to train, test, and tune linear classifiers in Python, and you'll develop a conceptual framework for understanding machine learning algorithms in general.

Course Takeaways:

* Applying logistic regression and SVM  
* Loss functions
* Logistic regression 
* Support Vector Machines
