    "We'll consolidate everything you've learned through an in-depth case study of GitHub collaborator network data. This is a great example of real-world social network data, and we have newly acquired skills will be fully tested. By the end of this chapter, we'll have developed our very own recommendation system to connect GitHub users who should collaborate together.\n",
