    "We will learn how to find interesting structures within network data by studying concepts such as cliques, communities, and subgraphs. This exercise will leverage your skills you acquired earlier in network analysis. We will apply the concepts we've learned in this chapter to a real-world case study by the end of this chapter.\n",
