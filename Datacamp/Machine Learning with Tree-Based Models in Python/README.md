Introduction  
  
Classification and regression problems can be solved with decision trees.  
  
The flexibility of tree models comes at a price: on the one hand, they capture complex nonlinear relationships; on the other hand, they can memorize the noise present
in a dataset. Ensemble methods take advantage of trees' flexibility while reducing their tendency to memorize noise by aggregating predictions from different trees.
Many machine learning competitions have been won by ensemble methods across a variety of fields.  

Course Takeaways:  

- With the user-friendly scikit-learn machine learning library, train decision trees and tree-based models in Python. 

- As we practice on real-world datasets, we'll learn how ensembling alleviates the shortcomings of trees. 

- We will also learn how to tune the most influential hyperparameters.
