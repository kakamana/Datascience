Introduction  

A powerful, general-purpose tool for working with Big Data, Spark transparently distributes compute tasks across a cluster. In addition to being fast, you can focus on the analysis instead of worrying about technical details. This course introduces Spark Machine Learning algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression/Classifiers, and pipelines, and explains how they work. We'll analyse flight delays and spam text messages along the way. With this background, you'll be poised to harness the power of Spark and apply it to your own Machine Learning projects.

Course Takeaways:

* Introduction 
* Classification 
* Regression
* Ensembles & Pipelines
