Introduction  

With hypothesis testing, we can answer statistically rigorous questions about your datasets. By using common Python analytical tests like t-tests, proportion tests, and chi-square tests, we can develop our Python analytical skills. We will explore how these tests work and the assumptions that underpin them by using real-world data, such as feedback from Stack Overflow users and medical supply chain data. In addition, non-parametric tests can be used to overcome traditional hypothesis testing limitations
