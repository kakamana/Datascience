    "# Building deep learning models with keras\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this chapter, you will build deep learning models for both regression and classification using the Keras library. In this chapter, you will learn about the Specify-Compile-Fit workflow, which can be used to make predictions, and by the end of the chapter, you will have all the tools necessary to construct deep neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This **Building deep learning models with keras** is part of [Datacamp course: Introduction to Deep Learning in Python] In a wide range of fields such as robotics, natural language processing, image recognition, and artificial intelligence, including AlphaGo, deep learning is the technique behind the most exciting capabilities. As part of this course, you will gain hands-on, practical experience using deep learning with Keras 2.0, the latest version of a cutting-edge Python library for deep learning.\n",
