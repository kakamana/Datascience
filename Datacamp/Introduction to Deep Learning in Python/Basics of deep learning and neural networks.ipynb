    "\n",
    "It is in this chapter that you will gain an understanding of the fundamental concepts and terminology used in deep learning, as well as why these techniques are so powerful today. With the help of simple neural networks, you will be able to generate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This **Basics of deep learning and neural networks** is part of [Datacamp course: Introduction to Deep Learning in Python] In a wide range of fields such as robotics, natural language processing, image recognition, and artificial intelligence, including AlphaGo, deep learning is the technique behind the most exciting capabilities. As part of this course, you will gain hands-on, practical experience using deep learning with Keras 2.0, the latest version of a cutting-edge Python library for deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is my learning experience of data science through DataCamp. These repository contributions are part of my learning journey through my graduate program masters of applied data sciences (MADS) at University Of Michigan, [DeepLearning.AI], [Coursera] & [DataCamp]. You can find my similar articles & more stories at my [medium] & [LinkedIn] profile. I am available at [kaggle] & [github blogs] & [github repos]. Thank you for your motivation, support & valuable feedback.\n",
