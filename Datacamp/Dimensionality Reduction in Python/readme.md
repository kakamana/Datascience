Introduction  

When you have too many dimensions, traditional methods of visual exploration may not be sufficient. High-dimensional datasets can be overwhelming and leave you confused. This course introduces you to visualization techniques designed specifically for high-dimensional data. It is often found that some features do not demonstrate variance or are duplicates of other features, so they hold little information. You will learn how to detect these features and remove them from the dataset so that you can focus on the informative ones. It may be that some of these features don't affect what you're trying to predict, so you might want to build a model on them. Finally, you will learn how feature extraction techniques can reduce dimensionality for you through the calculation of uncorrelated principal components, thereby reducing dimensionality and complexity.

Course Takeaways:

* Exploring High Dimensional Data  
* Feature Selection I - Selecting for Feature Information
* Feature Selection II - Selecting for Model Accuracy 
* Feature Extraction
