    "Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the most widely used dimensionality reduction algorithm, is covered briefly here. We will learn how and why this algorithm is so powerful, as well as how to apply it for data exploration and preprocessing as part of a modeling pipeline. We will conclude with an example of image compression.\n",
