Introduction  

The most advanced algorithms for computer vision couldn't distinguish between cats and dogs a decade ago. Data scientists can now classify tens of thousands of objects more accurately than they can with a laptop alone. This course uses TensorFlow 2.6 to develop, train, and predict models that have made major advances in recommendation systems, image classification, and FinTech. Both high-level APIs, which will enable you to create deep learning models in 15 lines of code, and low-level APIs, which will allow you to move beyond off-the-shelf solutions. As well as housing prices and credit card defaults, you will learn sign language images.

Course Takeaways:

* Introduction to TensorFlow  
* Linear models 
* Neural Networks
* High Level APIs
