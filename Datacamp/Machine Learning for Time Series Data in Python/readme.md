Introduction  

Data series can be defined as any signal that changes over time, whether it be stock market fluctuations, sensor data recording climate change, or brain activity. For generating predictions and insights into the problem one is trying to solve, machine learning is a powerful method for leveraging data complexity. Featuring feature engineering, spectograms, and other advanced techniques, this course combines machine learning and time series data to predict stock prices and classify heartbeat sounds.

Course Takeaways:

* Time Series and Machine Learning Primer  
* Time Series as Inputs to a Model
* Predicting Time Series Data
* Validating and Inspecting Time Series Models
